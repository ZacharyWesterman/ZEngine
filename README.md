# ZEngine
A real-time script parser using the Irrlicht API and Qt.

The end goal of this project is to allow users to quickly and easily create graphical programs such as games or scientific simulations by writing scripts in a C-similar language. 

A main point of the project is that the program will automatically handle all rendering details and resource management, so users never have to worry about when to refresh the screen or whether their program will freeze. Additionally, the parser is extensible, which means that an advanced user can add commands and functions to the parser without recompiling the program.

The core of the parser is currently in development, so there is no graphical display yet.
Also, it is important to note that this project requires my [zLibraries headers](https://github.com/ZacharyWesterman/zLibraries).
