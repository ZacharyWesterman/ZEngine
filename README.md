# zing
A fully extensible compiler and application engine.

**zing** allows for easy creation of graphical or terminal-based applications. Rendering and memory management are handled automatically so developers can focus on more important things.

zing programs may be run from previously compiled code *or* may be compiled and run realtime. The language these programs are written in is up to the user; even the compiler is fully extensible.

Note that this project is in an early stage of development and refactoring.

Depends on [libzed](https://github.com/ZacharyWesterman/libzed).
